    <h3><li>Harry Catches The Golden Snitch</li></h3>
        <p>Harry Potter was the youngest seeker of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in a century, being recruited as a seeker in just his first year. In his first match against rivals Slytherin, he catches the Golden Snitch in peculiar style to win the game for his house, Gryffindor:</p>

    <h3><li>Visiting The Burrow</li></h3>
        <p>Ron, Fred & George rescue Harry from the (usual) horrible time he is having at his Aunt and Uncle's house in their dad's flying car. Harry experiences what it's like to live in a magical home for the first time when he reaches The Burrow:</p>

    <h3><li>"Yer a wizard Harry"</li></h3>
        <p>Hagrid crashes the Dursleys hideout to hand Harry his Hogwarts letter + give him a birthday cake + deliver one of the most iconic lines in the entire series:</p>

    <h3><li>Remus Lupin's Boggart Class</li></h3>
        <p>Remus Lupin is probably the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher Harry and his friends have had, and he proves it in this entertaining lesson on Boggarts. It was also fun finding out the characters' various biggest fears and also created some suspense for the later parts of the movie:</p>

    <h3><li>The Triwizard Tournament</li></h3>
        <p>Making up the foundation of the fourth movie was the Triwizard Tournament. The Triwizard Tournament was a competition held between three wizarding schools: Hogwarts, Durmstrang, Beauxbatons - Each school would have one champion represent them to compete in a series of tasks to gain glory for their school. In this scene, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons make their entrance into Hogwarts:</p>

    <h3><li>Dumbledore's Army</li></h3>
        <p>With Umbridge being the worst teacher and human being the Harry Potter series has ever seen - Harry, Ron and Hermione take matters into their own hands and form 'Dumbledore's Army', a secret organisation founded by Hermione and taught by Harry, for students to learn some proper Defence Against The Dark Arts. The organisation met up secretly in the Room of Requirement:</p>

    <h3><li>"Harry Potter is Dead!"</li></h3>
        <p>Voldemort returns to Hogwarts and makes some grand speech about Harry Potter being dead. Harry begs to differ:</p>

    <h3><li>Snape's Memories</li></h3>
